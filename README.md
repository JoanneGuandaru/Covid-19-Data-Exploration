# Joanne-s-Portfolio-Project
Covid-19 Project

This project aimed to analyze Covid-19 data, focusing on key aspects such as infection rates, death percentages, and vaccination coverage across different countries and continents. The analysis explored various dimensions of the pandemic, including the relationship between total cases and deaths, infection rates relative to population, and trends in vaccination rollouts. The project also examined ICU admissions, hospitalization, and positivity rates to understand the healthcare strain caused by the virus.

Techniques Used:
Joins: To combine Covid-19 cases and vaccination data.
Aggregate Functions: For calculating totals, averages, and percentages, such as infection rates and death percentages.
Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Used for breaking down complex queries, like calculating positivity rates and ICU admissions.
Window Functions: Implemented to analyze rolling vaccination numbers and calculate the percentage of vaccinated populations.
Views: Created for recurring queries, such as tracking vaccination progress.
Data Cleaning: Adjustments were made to ensure data accuracy, such as handling invalid dates and missing information.

Key Insights:
Infection and Death Rates: Calculated the percentage of deaths from total cases, with countries and continents ranked based on their infection and death rates.
Population Impact: Analyzed how Covid-19 affected populations globally, identifying regions with the highest infection and death rates per population.
Healthcare Analysis: Explored ICU admissions and weekly hospitalizations as a percentage of the population, providing insights into the healthcare burden.
Vaccination Trends: Tracked rolling vaccination numbers and calculated the percentage of the population vaccinated, offering a clear picture of global vaccination efforts.
Positivity Rates: Evaluated the percentage of positive Covid-19 tests, helping to assess testing effectiveness.
